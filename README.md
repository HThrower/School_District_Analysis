# School_District_Analysis
Analysis of School and Student data using the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.

This is analysis is focused on understanding how a variety of schools compare to one another on the basis of total budget, budget per pupil, and test scores across reading and math. The analysis further segments schools down by size and type (charter or public). The analysis will be presented to the school board for education. A variant of the analysis has a grade from a high school removed due to a suspected fraudulent activity.

## Results:
